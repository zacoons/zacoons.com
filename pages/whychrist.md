Why Christianity? - zacoons' place ;z; Why should you worship God - Our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ - the one and only sovereign trinity

### The Atheisms

When I was younger I used to call myself an atheist, and I thought that was smart. But there was one thing that always stumped me. Where did the Big Bang come from? Well it seems there's an explanation for that. Apparently it has been observed that particles occasionally pop into existence and then shortly disappear as a result of quantum energy fluctuations. But where did that energy come from? In fact, where did time and space come from? Time is not constant, as shown by Einstein with his Theory of Relativity. Nor is space constant, which is demonstrated by wormholes. No matter how much the scientists discover, this question will always remain, "Cool, but what was before that?". Whatever you believe, you must take a leap of faith.

### Logic

There are certain things which aren't bound by space and time. They don't exist in this world. An example is logic. Logic never changes (just like God), and it exists without regard to physical things (just like God). It can't even be proven, because it is the basis of proof (just like God).

God calls Himself the Logos. "Logos" (λόγος) is the Greek word from which the word "logic" is derived from. It means "word", "discourse", or "reason". According to Wikipedia it is related to the Ancient Greek word "lego" (λέγω), which literally translates to "I say", and which has the same origin as the Latin word "lex" (lit. "law").

Anyway, all of this is to say that God is more than just logic. He is the Way, the Truth, and the Life (John 14:16).

### God is Good(ness)

God is the definition of good. There is no good without God (Matthew 19:17). Why would anybody be moral without God? Correct answer: they wouldnt. The concept of morality doesn't exist without God.

You might say, "You can be a good person without some stupid religion, dumbass." Let me explain. To an athiest, the purpose of being good is to survive. This means that in situations where morality has no effect, or negative effect, on their suvival, they would be free to abandon it. For example, if a bully beat up another kid, and nobody else was around, is that immoral? If you answered "yes" then there must be some higher moral standard than mere survival.

### Finis

We were created to worship God. As a result, we literally cannot live without worshipping something. If we reject God, then we are worshipping soemthing else. Even devoted atheists worship the god of nature. They adhere to the law of the jungle, and they follow a kind of morality that is determined by the necessities of survival. The classical philosophers were more explicit about their worship of "Nature", but it's no different these days. Everyone has a worldview. A worldview requires a defined sovereign being, even if that sovereign being is themself.

Whatever you believe, you believe it by faith. But if you don't believe in God, you are wrong. God is the Way, the Truth, and the Life. He _is_ the higher moral standard. Whether we worship Him, or something else, we are still worshipping something. Just make sure that something is Good.
